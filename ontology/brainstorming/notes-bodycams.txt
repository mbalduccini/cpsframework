Possible use case(s)
	Body cameras
	emergency response (firefighters? -- division at NIST)


================== BODY CAMERAS ==================

Known episodes:
	webcam footage: police officers investigating black lady. Started searching vehicle. Obstructed view. Which kind of concern?
	Camera image; infer physical location from image; can be verified in physical ways. Can be used to mitigate risks of cyber-intrusion


CLASSES
=======

body cameras: sensors
location sensors: sensors
alarm sirens: actuators


OBJECTS
=======
% Need to describe: physical interaction, logical interaction, sensing, actuation, human role
bc1, bc2,...: body cameras
actors
server
steam-tampering: events

resilience, reliability, privacy, safety, security elements: trustworthiness elements

cyber-security elements, physical security elements: security elements
confidentiality, integrity, availability: cyber-security elements [HOW ARE THEY LINKED TO "security"???] [WHAT ABOUT PHYSICAL SECURITY???]

	comprises camera

"axiom"
**	if data-flow goes from X to Y and
           X comprises Z
	then
	   exists data-flow' from from Z to Y

**	if X comprises Z and
	   Z is-affected-by Attack
	then
	   X is-affected-by Attack
	{ in principle, X may have its own defenses, which defeat the attack at the macro-level }

===> attack may cause device to be disabled, which affects AVAILABILITY
===> attack may cause device's data-stream to be altered or replaced, which affects INTEGRITY
===> attack may cause device's data-stream to be stolen, which affects CONFIDENTIALITY


Cyber Security: CIA of data streams
	Important if used in court
	Potential approach: timestamp

data-streams:
	data-streams generated-by body-cameras
	data-streams constrained-by cyber-security-elements

FAILURES / FAILURE MODES / VARIATIONS IN FUNCTION (too much, too little, intermittent)
+ got sound but no video



"(COMPETENCY) QUESTIONS"
+ do I still have audio and video?
+ do I still have trustworthy body-cam functions?
	parts to body-cam (mic, cam, ...)
+ which body-cam functions are still trustworthy?
	overheating makes for a thermal hazard, but it's still producing trustworthy data stream
	...Q's from Marcello here...
	 what is a body-cam function???
	 what is overheating???
	 what is thermal hazard???
	 what is "producing data stream"???
	 when is data stream trustworthy???
	...Q's from Marcello here...
+ which ways of tampering with the trustworthiness of the system can be detected?
+ are the interactions typical of the system authorized or unauthorized?
	i.e. is there some command that proves authenticity?
        ex2: intruders may attempt to replace A/V with fake ones
	     we would like to monitor that authorization measures have been respected
	     if we find a violation, that's an indication that the system has been manipulated

% AI connected to a body camera
% body cam picking up readings, uses ML and recognizes faces, objects (e.g., weapons)
% and making recommendations to human agent, e.g. "pull gun"
% OR it can inform nearby policemen about actors, risks and recommendations

% Capture sensing info that is not visible to human, but is processed by equipment
%   face recognition, object recognition, event/activity recognition: purely logical
%   making recommendations/generating warnings: can be viewed as actuation
%     e.g. warning policeman that a gun was identified
%          OR policeman weapons are only activated/unlocked in the presence of a threat
%          OR anomaly detection: if the cam notices attempts at tampering with the stream, the input should be sent to a safer storage
%	NOTE: actor manipulating stream of images: related to integrity and possibly other elements of security
%	      so, we need some kind of notation letting us say that parts are related to elements of security



%   Are there objects to represent privacy, safety, etc.?
%   Are they in this ontology? Or in another one?
