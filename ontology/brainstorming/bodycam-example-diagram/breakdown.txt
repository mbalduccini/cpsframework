Business Case
=============
	Integrated body security system

	Monitors the activity of safety personnel in the course 
	of the response to an incident.
	Provides some kind of alarm capability that can be triggered
	by the person wearing the integrated body security system.
	Enables the transfer of A/V/Data/Info to a storage system
	in a trustworthy way.
	If trustworthy, it may be used in litigation.

Use case
========
	(enumerates scenarios (aka features)
	 finite number of steps that describe 
	 interactions between the actors)

	Realtime awareness scenario 1 (of safety person's status when responding)
		pick up audio and video
		provide awareness by alerting a remote operator
	Realtime awareness scenario 2 (of safety person's status when responding)
		pick up audio and video
		capture information about the situation for later analysis
	Situation is out-of-hand
		Safety person has an opportunity to sound an alarm siren

	Actors: (they become blackboxes)
		camera
		mic
		siren
		processor
		server
		storage
		operator (receiving the warning)
		environment

CPS
===
	integrated camera-mic-siren

Physical (interactions)
=======================
	siren produces an audible signal
		influence: audible signal
		energy: vibrations in the air
	
	cellular network that processes the call
		establishes connection between dispatcher and injured party

Logical (interactions)
======================
	siren (if it is a digital warning sent to the station)
	camera sends videofeed to processor
		messaging: AES-encoded sequence of bytes
		info: videofeed (digitalized video signal)

Questions (first take)
======================
Does the avfeed stored by server have high integrity?
  (integrity = not been compromised; may refer to failure or being worn out)
	it can refer to cybersecurity or to physical security (walking into the room where data is stored)

Question Type 1
	asked at a high level of abstraction of the decomposition
	describe (in English) how it is mapped to statements at the low-level 
	of the decomposition, which can be automatically checked

Question Type 2
	mid-level question, competence of the low-level of the 
	system that is handling the CPS-level interactions

Question Type 3
	low-level question, involves exchanges of information (messaging, signals)
	and technical expertise
