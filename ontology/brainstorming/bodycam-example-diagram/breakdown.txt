Business Case
=============
	Integrated body security system

	Monitors the activity of safety personnel in the course 
	of the response to an incident.
	Provides some kind of alarm capability that can be triggered
	by the person wearing the integrated body security system.
	Enables the transfer of A/V/Data/Info to a storage system
	in a trustworthy way.
	If trustworthy, it may be used in litigation.


Use case
========
	(enumerates scenarios (aka features), finite number of steps that describe 
	 interactions between the actors)

	Realtime awareness scenario 1 (of safety person's status when responding)
		pick up audio and video
		provide awareness by alerting a remote operator
	Realtime awareness scenario 2 (of safety person's status when responding)
		pick up audio and video
		capture information about the situation for later analysis
	Situation is out-of-hand
		Safety person has an opportunity to sound an alarm siren
	Forensics
		have a log of when camera/mic fail or of when office shuts them off
		having a log would enable forensic audit

	System governance between logical and physical
		if you have reason to doubt logical info from the system
		you may do a second measurement on the system
		to make sure the signal is coming through properly

	Actors: (they become blackboxes)
		environment
		camera
		mic
		siren
		SAM (Situational Awareness Module)
		storage
		command center (receiving the warning)
		// note:
		//   [EG] command center & storage should be separate to avoid compromising investigations, e.g. into officer's conduct
		//   [MB] Can we formulate this as a question? That is, do not separate command center & storage and ask whether a certain key property is/isn't satisfied


CPS
===
	Integrated body security system (integrated camera-mic-siren)


Physical interactions
=====================
	camera receives video signal from environment
		influence: video signal
		energy: electromagnetic waves (visible part of the spectrum)

	mic receives video signal from environment
		influence: audio signal
		energy: sound waves (vibrations in the air)

	siren produces an audible signal
		influence: audible signal
		energy: sound waves (vibrations in the air)
	
	cellular network that processes the call [TBD]
		establishes connection between dispatcher and injured party
		influence: wireless signal
		energy: electromagnetic waves


Logical interactions
====================
	camera sends videofeed to SAM
		messaging: sequence of bytes
			- example refinement: AES-encoded 
		information: videofeed (digitalized video signal)

	mic sends audiofeed to SAM
		messaging: sequence of bytes
			- example refinement: AES-encoded 
		information: audiofeed (digitalized audio signal)

	SAM sends alarm to command center (if it is a digital warning sent to the command center)
		messaging: alarm packet
		information: type of alarm, timestamp, location, officer ID

	SAM sends sound command to siren
		messaging: command packet
		information: type of sound, volume

	SAM sends multimedia feed to storage
		messaging: sequence of bytes
			- example refinement: AES-encoded 
		information: combined videofeed from camera and audiofeed from mic


Questions (first take, to be revised later)
===========================================
Does the avfeed stored by server have high integrity?
  (integrity = not been compromised; may refer to failure or being worn out)
	it can refer to cybersecurity or to physical security (walking into the room where data is stored)

Question Type 1
	asked at a high level of abstraction of the decomposition
	describe (in English) how it is mapped to statements at the low-level 
	of the decomposition, which can be automatically checked

Question Type 2
	mid-level question, competence of the low-level of the 
	system that is handling the CPS-level interactions

Question Type 3
	low-level question, involves exchanges of information (messaging, signals)
	and technical expertise
